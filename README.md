# URL Shortner/TinyURL
TinyURL is a URL shortening service where we enter a URL such as https://leetcode.com/problems/design-tinyurl and it returns a short URL such as http://tinyurl.com/4e9iAk.

There are encode and decode methods for the URL Shortner service. There is no restriction on how we encode/decode algorithm should work. We just need to ensure that a URL can be encoded to a tiny URL and the tiny URL can be decoded to the original URL.
